# what is "test first" ?

1. write a test (it fails)
2. write the implementation (test still fails)
3. fix the implementation 
4. test passes: you're done!

# what is "TDD" ?

1. Q: what should the program do? 
2. A: integration test. (write it. it fails)
3. Q: how should the program do it?
4. A: unit test. (write it. it fails)
5. implement the unit 
6. does the unit test pass? if not, got back to 5
7. does the integration test pass? if not, go back to 3

# this semester

* we write tests
* if we're very good, we write test firsts
* ... we'll get to TDD later ...
